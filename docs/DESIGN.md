## Default path
`scripts` subdirectory in the Nushell's config folder. Type `$nu.config-path|path dirname` in your shell to find it.

## Cache index
By default, the cache index refreshes after a day from previous download.

Can be modified in `nupac.nu/freshness` but it's advised to keep it this way (one can simply use `nupac refresh` when needed).
